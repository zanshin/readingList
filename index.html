Zig hits the sweet spot for systems programming. This new programming language is high-performance, low-level, ultra-reliable, and perfectly suited for serious projects like writing libraries, daemons and shell utilities, and even operating systems and embedded code. Systems Programming with Zig shows you how to write quality, useful Zig applications without relying on libraries or frameworks-even if you’re new systems programming.  In Systems Programming with Zig you’ll learn how to:  Understand the Zig perspective on systems programming Write idiomatic Zig code Integrate Zig with C, systems libraries, and scripting languages Networking, interpreters, and graphics from the ground up   Unlike UI-centric applications that form the public face of your software, systems programs like OS kernels, device drivers, and utilities interact directly with the hardware or operating system. In these low-level programs, performance and safety are paramount. Zig is a new programming language that builds on the legacy of C, C++, and even Rust to provide a high-productivity systems programming environment that does not rely on awkward libraries and frameworks.</span></li><li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2025/10/03/fuck-you-make-me">Daring Fireball: &#39;Fuck You, Make Me&#39;</a> - 2025-10-03<span class="secondary"> - Link to: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohPToBog_-g</span></li><li><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/01/t-magazine/magazine-covers-esquire-rolling-stone.html?unlocked_article_code=1.qk8.LDKl.N1yb1OvQi3rZ">The 25 Most Influential Magazine Covers of All Time - The New York Times</a> - 2025-10-03<span class="secondary"> - Four editors, a creative director and a visual artist met to debate and discuss the best of print media — and its enduring legacy.</span></li><li><a href="https://gist.github.com/chockenberry/b41883352330db4587a62f8132bbd62e">dfn.sh</a> - 2025-10-03<span class="secondary"> - GitHub Gist: instantly share code, notes, and snippets.</span></li><li><a href="https://corrode.dev/blog/simple/">Be Simple | corrode Rust Consulting</a> - 2025-10-03 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45309756" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - The phone buzzes at 3 AM.

The 2,890-metre-long structure, which took more than three years to complete, reduces travel time between the two sides of the canyon from two hours to two minutes.

The author was motivated by the observation that nearly every CLI tool reinvents the wheel with similar validation patterns for dependent options, mutually exclusive options, and environment-specific requirements. Optique leverages parser combinators and TypeScript&#39;s type inference to ensure that CLI arguments are parsed directly into valid configurations, eliminating the need for manual validation. By describing the desired CLI configuration with Optique, TypeScript automatically infers the types and constraints, catching potential bugs at compile time. The author shares their experience of deleting large chunks of validation code and simplifying refactoring tasks.

I was twenty two years old and about to start as a graduate student at Princeton. I have been here more or less the whole time since. I spent six years on an F-1 Visa while getting my PhD. After that, I lived and worked in Tucson for seven years. My conception of what counts as an inhumanly hot day changed. During that time I was on an H1-B Visa sponsored by my employer, the University of Arizona. Subsequently, I was granted Permanent Residency—a Green Card—through marriage. In 2009 I moved to North Carolina. My conception of what counts as an intolerably humid day changed. I am an immigrant to this country. I have made my life here. My two children are Americans.

This is especially useful when dealing with spawning processes or threads as otherwise, strace will only trace the parent process. -v: Print unabbreviated versions of environment, stat, termios and other structs in  syscalls. I found this invaluable in conjunction with -s when doing assembly programming to check if the structs were being initialized correctly and if certain arguments were being sent in little/big endian format -s NUM: Specify the maximum string size to print. Useful for large structs -o: Save strace output to a log file. It is always better to do this to investigate the output of the original process and strace separately without each cluttering the other -yy: Print all available information associated with file descriptors. This is great for expanding the file descriptor to either its full path in case of a file or TCP address in case of sockets -Y: Print command names for PIDs. I found this useful when building the shell to check if the correct program is being executed -t: Print current timestamp in log -T: Show time spent in syscalls. Useful for some basic profiling although strace heavily slows down the process. -r: Print a relative timestamp upon entry to each system call -n: Print syscall number. Great to quickly find out syscall numbers on new architectures. -i: Print instruction pointer at the time of syscall. Found this useful when debugging assembly code to check rough location of errors. -C: Print summary of syscall count, time, errors at the end of regular output  Print stack traces The -k or --stack-trace prints the stacktrace along with the syscall. This is useful if your program is compiled with with -g. This post is a good read on using strace to show backtraces for a Golang program compiled with GODEBUG.</span></li><li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/culture/2025/06/review-the-john-wick-franchise-is-alive-and-kicking-with-ballerina/">Review: The John Wick franchise is alive and kicking with Ballerina - Ars Technica</a> - 2025-06-14<span class="secondary"> - With her fierce performance, Ana de Armas proves she’s well up to the task of carrying on the Wick legacy.</span></li><li><a href="https://cupofjo.com/2025/06/11/nigella-lawson-guinness-cake/">I Couldn&#39;t Stop Thinking About This Cake, So I Tracked Down The Recipe | Cup of Jo</a> - 2025-06-14<span class="secondary"> - A cake so good, I ate it for breakfast.</span></li><li><a href="https://inessential.com/2025/06/13/saturday-march.html">inessential: Saturday March</a> - 2025-06-14</li><li><a href="https://duncan.dev/link/zed-agentic-editing">Zed’s agentic editing features released</a> - 2025-06-14<span class="secondary"> - Zed’s new agentic coding feature is out, and it’s really good.

Our lives are extensively documented on the phones, laptops, and other electronic devices we carry. Our devices can store an unprecedented amount of highly personal information about us, including private emails and text messages, photos and videos, web browsing history, and other data that can reveal our political and religious affiliations, medical conditions, family and romantic lives, financial status, and much more. People in many professions, such as lawyers and journalists, have a heightened need to keep their digital data confidential. The U.S. Constitution generally places strong limits on the government’s ability to pry into our private lives. At the U.S. border, however, those limits are not as strong—a fact EFF is working to change. The “border search exception” to the Fourth Amendment’s warrant requirement has traditionally permitted border agents to conduct warrantless and usually suspicionless searches on the legal assumption that travelers have negligible privacy interests in the contents of their luggage. The &#34;border&#34; includes ports of entry at the land borders, international airports, and seaports. But electronic devices turn this reasoning on its head: your privacy interests in your phone, laptop, or tablet are extraordinary given the vastness of storage capacity, variety of content, and personal aspects of your life that electronic devices contain. EFF argues that a warrant based on probable cause, issued by a judge, is required for border device searches. It’s past time for a new analysis of privacy at the border. EFF is working on many fronts to protect your digital rights when you cross the U.S. border: Read our comprehensive travel guide on how to protect your digital data when crossing the U.S. border, as well as our pocket guides. Learn the extensive facts about how CBP and ICE conduct border device searches that we uncovered during our civil case with ACLU, Merchant v. Mayorkas (formerly Alasaad v. [DHS Secretary]), where we represented  11 plaintiffs in challenging under the First and Fourth Amendments the U.S. government’s practice of conducting warrantless and suspicionless border searches of electronic devices. Read one of our many amicus briefs: Elsharkawi v. United States (9th Circuit). Read the whitepaper we wrote for the American Constitution Society. Read our analysis of proposed legislation. Read our analysis of CBP’s current (2018) border device search policy. Check out all of our work on border searches below, and join EFF to help support our efforts. Self-Help Options If Your Device Was Seized or You&#39;re Repeatedly Referred to Secondary Inspection If your device was seized, did you get the name and contact information of a CBP or ICE supervisor when you received the custody receipt (Form 6051D)? If so, try contacting them. Otherwise, try contacting the relevant port of entry or field office. File a complaint with the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (DHS TRIP). File a complaint with CBP. Contact ICE (e.g., Office of Information Governance &amp; Privacy or Office of Diversity &amp; Civil Rights). File a DHS civil rights/civil liberties complaint. Contact the DHS Inspector General. For U.S. persons: Contact your senators or congressional representative, and ask them to contact CBP/ICE on your behalf.  File a Freedom of Information Act/Privacy Act request. You can submit requests via the CBP website or the ICE website. You can also use the nonprofit website Muckrock to file requests with CBP or ICE.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.caseyliss.com/2025/3/22/excising-dropbox">Excising Dropbox — Liss is More</a> - 2025-03-22 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43447002" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - I still use Dropbox, but I haven&#39;t had a client app installed in several years.

I had a lot of fun building it and it was an application that I used on a near-daily basis. However, around August last year I realised it was time for me to move on from Pinboard and try something new; based on various recommendations I settled on Raindrop. As mentioned in the other blog post, Raindrop offered more or less everything I had with Pinboard and so the move was fairly straightforward. The one thing that was missing though was an application similar to Tinboard. So, late on last year, with my winter break approaching, I decided to start from scratch and build a &#34;Tinboard for Raindrop&#34;, which I&#39;m calling Braindrop. This was going to be a bit of an adventure too. Since being laid off from Textualize earlier in 2024 I&#39;d not been following its development quite as closely as I used to, and had also run into some issues and bugs with it since that time; moreover, as well as various bugs appearing, some breaking changes had also been made. As such this was going to be a process where I&#39;d wrap my head around what&#39;s happened with the framework over the prior six months or so. Given all this, over the past couple of weeks I&#39;ve been spending a few hours a day doing some for-pleasure coding and v0.1.0 of Braindrop is the result. As much as possible I&#39;ve tried to keep the look and feel similar to that of Tinboard, while also doing my best to avoid some of the &#34;ah, I wish I hadn&#39;t done it this way&#34; design decisions I&#39;d made. As of the time of writing I&#39;m very pleased with the result. One thing I did want to do is ensure that the application was as keyboard-friendly as possible, while also still allowing use of the mouse. Textual can sometimes get that wrong and I ran into an example of this while trying to ensure that there&#39;s good in-application help. Somewhat recently Textual added a built-in help system which, sadly, can&#39;t easily be used by and navigated by someone using the keyboard. So instead I&#39;ve recreated the help system I built into Tinboard, while adopting the documentation standard that Textual had settled on (which, coincidentally, was kind of similar to what I did in Tinboard to start with). As with Tinboard, I&#39;ve also made sure to make full use of the command palette, with every action that makes sense having a keyboard hotkey as well as a command in the palette. I also took things a little further and made sure that the hotkeys are shown in the command palette for easier discovery. I&#39;ve also made sure that Textual&#39;s new theme system is available for easy use; so out goes dark/light mode toggling and in comes a collection of different themes. Here&#39;s a wee selection as an example: That&#39;s a small selection of the themes, with more to explore. There&#39;s a few more things I want to do before I consider the application v1.0-ready, but it&#39;s already in use by me and working well. As I decide what else I want to add to it I&#39;m building up a list of TODO items. Given that my day job these days is quite varied, isn&#39;t quite so coding-intensive, and isn&#39;t always related to all things Python, it&#39;s actually been fun to sit down and hack up a pure Python application from scratch again. It&#39;s also helped me discover a couple or so fresh bugs in Textual (which I&#39;ve reported, of course) and given me the opportunity to PR some trivial fixes as I&#39;ve noticed typos and stuff as I go. Anyway; that&#39;s v0.1.0 out in the wild. I&#39;m pleased with how it&#39;s turned out and there&#39;s more to come. It&#39;s licensed GPL-3.0 and available via GitHub and also via PyPi. If you have an environment that has pipx installed you should be able to get up and going with: $ pipx install braindrop It can also be installed with Homebrew by tapping davep/homebrew and then installing braindrop: $ brew tap davep/homebrew $ brew install braindrop I hope this is useful to someone else. :-)</span></li><li><a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/documenting-1115-ft-radio-tower-climb">Documenting an 1115 ft radio tower climb | Jeff Geerling</a> - 2025-01-05 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42578201" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://charliesykes.substack.com/p/bowing-the-knee-again">Bowing the Knee.

A. A. Milne&#39;s Winnie-the-Pooh. https://gutenberg.org/ebooks/67098  The conversion of all 75,000 texts in Project Gutenberg to Accessible EPUB3 is an ongoing collective effort, but the last missing piece for Pooh was to supply image descriptions in alt text worthy of this iconic work. I hope we&#39;ve mostly succeeded!  With work being done to implement the Marrakesh Treaty, national &#34;authorized entities&#34; are now able to share accessible versions of in-copyright works with each other internationally, but  we don&#39;t have to wait for that in the case of works in the Public Domain. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrakesh_VIP_Treaty  Project Gutenberg&#39;s accessible version of Winnie-the-Pooh can be shared freely throughout the world. If you don&#39;t like the added alt text, you are free to change it! (but maybe you&#39;d prefer to work on one of the thousands of books that don&#39;t yet have image descriptions for the visually impaired!)  Creating alt text for a work of fiction is both hard work and a lot of fun. The descriptions have to fit in to the narrative of the text, without adding subjective interpretation of the illustrations. Not easy at all!  For example, the alt text for the illustration showing Pooh peering up at the bees can&#39;t call them bees, because in the next sentence, Pooh  thinks: &#34;That buzzing-noise means something. You don&#39;t get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something.&#34; https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/67098/pg67098-images.html#img_images_illus15.jpg  For Pooh, some technical corrections were necessary as well. The horizontal rules around the illustrations needed to be silenced with the HTML5 aria-hidden attribute. Six illustrations needed to be moved up or down a sentence to fit into the narrative.  In Chapter 7, the sentence: &#34;If this is flying I shall never really take to it.&#34; had been rendered across 3 lines with margins and spaces, jumbling the word order. A change to vertical-align rendering makes it more accessible to everybody - I could copy and paste it! https://gutenberg.org/cache/epub/67098/pg67098-images.html#images/illus73.jpg  We&#39;ve played with AI for image description, and the results are quite good for complex figures and the like, but it will be quite a while before AI image descriptions can be set loose without human editors, especially for works like Pooh. AI&#39;s can completely whiff on the simplest images!  We&#39;re working to create UIs for alt text editing and creation to enable more people to help out in accessibility mitigation. Maybe one of these people will be you! There are thousand of books that need help.</span></li><li><a href="https://quakkels.com/posts/202412_01_goodbye_github_pages_hello_coolify/">Goodbye Github Pages, Hello Coolify · Quakkels.com</a> - 2025-01-01<span class="secondary"> - Coolify is more than just a tool that lets me self host my blog.

While setting it up on a server, I came across this shell script2 that configures the ufw firewall on Linux to ensure direct communication across different nodes in my tailnet. It has the following block of code that I found interesting (added comments for clarity): #!/usr/bin/env bash  # Define the path for the PID file, using the script&#39;s name to ensure uniqueness PIDFILE=&#34;/tmp/$(basename &#34;${BASH_SOURCE[0]%.*}.pid&#34;)&#34;  # Open file descriptor 200 for the PID file exec 200&gt;&#34;${PIDFILE}&#34;  # Try to acquire a non-blocking lock; exit if the script is already running flock -n 200 \     || {         echo &#34;${BASH_SOURCE[0]} script is already running.

If another process already holds the lock, the script either waits or exits immediately.

Over the past decade, I’ve spent countless hours tinkering my worfklow to be just so. Reading docs and articles, meticulously tweaking settings and even writing an extension. I used to be very passionate about Mercurial. But as time went on, the culture at Mozilla started changing. More and more repos were created in Github, and more and more developers started using git-cinnabar to work on mozilla-central. Then my role changed and I found that 90% of my work was happening outside of mozilla-central and the Mercurial garden I had created for myself. So it was with a sense of resigned inevitability that I took the news that Mozilla would be migrating mozilla-central to Git. The fire in me was all but extinguished, I was resigned to my fate. And what’s more, I had to agree. The time had come for Mozilla to officially make the switch. Glandium wrote an excellent post outlining some of the history of the decisions made around version control, putting them into the context of the time. In that post, he offers some compelling wisdom to Mercurial holdouts like myself:  I’ll swim against the current here, and say this: the earlier you can switch to git, the earlier you’ll find out what works and what doesn’t work for you, whether you already know Git or not.  When I read that, I had to agree. But, I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. No, if I was going to have to give up my revsets and changeset obsolesence and my carefully curated workflows, then so be it. But damnit! I was going to continue using them for as long as possible. And I’m glad I didn’t switch because then I stumbled upon Jujutsu.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2024/nov/13/why-the-guardian-is-no-longer-posting-on-x">Why the Guardian is no longer posting on X | Social media | The Guardian</a> - 2024-11-13 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42129924" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - We will stop posting from our official editorial accounts on the platform, but X users can still share our articles</span></li><li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/11/this-elephant-figured-out-how-to-use-a-hose-to-shower/">This elephant figured out how to use a hose to shower - Ars Technica</a> - 2024-11-13<span class="secondary"> - A younger rival may have learned how to sabotage those showers by disrupting water flow.</span></li><li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/11/12/find-my-airtags-airlines">Daring Fireball: Also Now In Public Beta: Find My Enables Sharing Location of Lost Items With Third Parties, Including Airlines</a> - 2024-11-13<span class="secondary"> - Link to: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/11/apples-find-my-enables-sharing-location-of-lost-items-with-third-parties/</span></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/6/24289649/big-tech-leaders-donald-trump-presidential-election">All the Big Tech leaders congratulating Donald Trump - The Verge</a> - 2024-11-13<span class="secondary"> - Tech leaders are cozying up to Trump.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/nov/12/spanish-police-arrest-ex-fraud-chief-after-20m-found-in-walls-of-his-house">Spanish police arrest ex-fraud chief after €20m found in walls of his house | Spain | The Guardian</a> - 2024-11-12 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42119575" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - Investigation into country’s largest cocaine bust reveals cash in home of former head of anti-money laundering</span></li><li><a href="https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2024/m4-mac-minis-efficiency-incredible">M4 Mac mini&#39;s efficiency is incredible | Jeff Geerling</a> - 2024-11-12 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42120311" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/11/there-are-some-things-the-crew-8-astronauts-arent-ready-to-talk-about/">There are some things the Crew-8 astronauts aren’t ready to talk about - Ars Technica</a> - 2024-11-12<span class="secondary"> - “I did not say I was uncomfortable talking about it.

Politics One thing about Germany, and Europe in general, is that it’s relatively left-wing when compared to the US. This is a place where universal healthcare is so commonly accepted that no party – not even the super-racist party! – is talking about removing it. The aforementioned super-racist party has effectively the same political platform as the mainstream Republican party in the US (minus the healthcare thing). Politics in Europe certainly has its own problems, but at least in Germany there is a flourishing multi-party system that allows for people to have some kind of choice when voting. There is even a fun website called the “Wahl-o-Mat” (“Vote-o-Matic”) that tells you which party to vote for after answering a series of questions.

Motivation Why you should do it You’re probably not going to do something just because someone online tells you to do it, but I might as well give you some motivation on why moving is a good idea. There are the more abstract reasons, like “living abroad expands how you think about the world,” lifestyle/political reasons like experiencing life in a place with universal healthcare, and more prosaic reasons like enjoying techno music. Personally, I just really liked Berlin and was at a point in my life and career where making such a move was possible – things aligned, and I knew that such an opportunity wouldn’t happen again soon.

This kicked off a couple of months back when I made a decision unrelated to coding. On and off, since my teenage years, I&#39;ve kept journals. Since those teenage years it&#39;s been more off than on, but a couple of times in my adult life it&#39;s been really helpful to actually write one. The last time this happened was early 2019. It was pretty vital I did that at the time and it was a really sensible and helpful decision, and an approach to the situation I was in that I&#39;d recommend to anyone (and have done on occasion to anyone going through the same thing). The actual motivation for starting that particular journal is long behind me, but I&#39;d got into the habit of writing it and so, until a couple or so months back, I kept jotting something down every day. But I came to the realisation that I didn&#39;t need to and that it had become something of a chore. I&#39;d been using an application called Journey. It&#39;s a great app, does the job well, but was also suffering from the creep of &#34;AI&#34; (I&#39;ve had a few apps ion my arsenal that don&#39;t need it, acquire a useless &#34;AI&#34; feature). This privacy-problematic change of direction, combined with the realisation that I didn&#39;t need to write about my day, every day, any more, made me decide it was time to stop and cancel the subscription. Thankfully Journey has a pretty comprehensive export option so I used it and didn&#39;t think too much more about it for a while. Meanwhile I also had a subscription to Evernote that I didn&#39;t really use any more. Within it I had held a handful of years of journal entries from a decade or so ago, along with other &#34;remember this for some point in the future&#34; stuff. For the longest time I was on some really cheap tier that didn&#39;t exist any more, one that was low enough that I didn&#39;t really notice the cost go out each month so I kept putting off exporting things and closing it all down until &#34;next month&#34;. Then I got an email from them to say they were forcing me onto some new tier that was more expensive. So that was the final straw there. I made an export of what I had in Evernote and closed that account down too. A wee while went past and then I got to thinking that it might be interesting to try and combine both these sources into one archived journal. I had stuff from around 2010 to 2015, and I also had stuff from 2019 until 2024; the former in the Evernote archive and the latter in the Journey archive. Surely I could write a couple of tools to turn that data into one consolidated Obsidian Vault? Over the course of a couple of weekends journey2md and evernote2md were born. While both of those tools work differently, they&#39;re both designed to populate the same Obsidian Vault. Once I was happy with this I did the mass conversion and I was happy with the result. Now I have years of journal entries, all converted to Markdown files and made available for reading via an application that lets me rummage through history using dates and tags and all sorts of other searching. So I was happy with that and didn&#39;t give it much more though. Then last week I got to thinking... Twitter has turned into the worst place possible and I can&#39;t for the life of me think why any right-thinking person who has an ounce of humanity or has anything approaching a humanistic outlook on life would remain an active user. Honestly I stuck it out longer than was sensible, but in June 2023 I finally quit for good. Back when the new owner was confirmed I, like a lot of people, extracted my archive. It&#39;s since been sat in storage doing nothing, yet there&#39;s a lot of data in there that could be interesting to work with, or just to go back and look through. So last week&#39;s thought was &#34;why don&#39;t I also turn this into an Obsidian Vault?&#34;. So I did... The tool I built to do this is bird2glass. As you&#39;ll see in the README it makes a few assumptions about the state of Twitter archive dumps and also what a user wants from this. Personally I&#39;m pleased with the result. The main aim of the tool is to break the tweets down into a hierarchy of year, month and day... ...and also to connect them with any account that was being replied to or mentioned in some way... This user view is handy when viewing backlinks, as it gives you a list of all the tweets that mention that user (and, of course, if you&#39;re into Obsidian&#39;s graph it will make for some interesting connections within there). I sense there&#39;s more I can do with this, and I imagine I will continue to tinker with it. Meanwhile though, if that sounds like something you&#39;d benefit from do feel free to grab it and play with it and hack on it. Keep in mind the notes and assumptions that are in the README, and really be prepared for a lot of files to be created if you did a lot of tweeting like I did (I do think that over 50,000 individual files for an Obsidian Vault is a bit silly, if I&#39;m honest).

Business leaders can learn valuable lessons from this study to implement a successful hybrid work model: establishing rigorous performance management systems, coordinating team or company-level hybrid schedules, and securing support from firm leadership. Additionally, executives should A/B test their own management practices to find what works best for them.</span></li><li><a href="https://gaultier.github.io/blog/lessons_learned_from_a_successful_rust_rewrite.html">Lessons learned from a successful Rust rewrite</a> - 2024-10-30 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41994189" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://ssoready.com/blog/engineering/truths-programmers-timezones/">Australia/Lord_Howe is the weirdest timezone | SSOReady</a> - 2024-10-30 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41992314" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - Timezones are weird.

We may not have wished to know, and perhaps it was easier to push away that sense of impending sadness, the awareness that time was short, but we knew what was coming. After August, after the resignation, we knew. And yet, it&#39;s still shocking. It still hurts.  Steve Jobs was a father and a husband, and the loss for his family -- having suffered with him through the acute, chronic and finally terminal phases of his illness -- is simply unfathomable. For those of us who have seen a family member or loved one taken away decades too soon by this loathsome disease, who know intimately the costs of cancer and its consequences, this is far too familiar. We feel the bereft emptiness they feel now as an echo of our own pain, a sharp pull on the cord of sorrow that connects us to our own absences of the heart.  As for the rest of us: perhaps we had briefly encountered Steve at Macworld Expo in years past, or been privileged to see him deliver one of his legendary keynote addresses in person. Perhaps we got a terse reply to an email about a problem, or heard from an Apple support team member that Steve had personally escalated an issue on our behalf. Perhaps the connection was entirely one-way, and our perception of Steve was delivered at a distance. It does not matter. For all of us who were touched by his life&#39;s work, we feel a sense of loss that is surprising in its intensity.  Part of that feeling is anger. Fifty-six. Fifty-six years young and you imagine, you try and simply fail to imagine what could have emerged from a full lifespan, from that kind of creative force. The world is poorer for the lack of another twenty years of Steve Jobs&#39;s brain, his energy, his judgement, his almost uncanny power to force reality to conform to his expectations rather than the other way around. Selfishly and callously we are angry, for what was taken from us, but that is part of grief too; part of knowing that you had something wonderful that you never properly appreciated until, suddenly, it was gone. Imagine how difficult it was for Tim Cook to introduce the iPhone 4S on Tuesday when he certainly knew that his own iPhone would be ringing soon with such horrible news. We are glad Tim is there, but we are still very, very angry Steve is gone.  Another part is awe. How many second acts in business lead to the kind of success that Apple has found over the past decade? One, really; what Steve did in returning to Apple is unique. After wandering in the wilderness, fired from the company he created with Ronald Wayne and Steve Wozniak in that legendary garage, Steve did astonishing things again and again.  Pixar, created from the unsuccessful Lucasfilm computer animation group, set free the remarkable creativity of John Lasseter and his band of perfectionist maniacs as they became the heir to Walt Disney&#39;s legacy -- and eventually, the artistic core of Disney&#39;s animation division, in the process making Jobs the entertainment megacorp&#39;s largest individual shareholder. Jobs&#39;s longstanding admiration of Walt Disney found its natural conclusion as Steve was effectively granted the keys to the Magic Kingdom.   NeXT, built around the idea of a desktop computing experience without compromises in performance or ease of use, may not have taken over the world with hardware sales: the machines themselves were perhaps too good for the market, too expensive for business or home users. But they gained popularity in academic and scientific settings like CERN (where a NeXT workstation responded to the first http:// prompt) and Wolfram Research (where the flagship product, Mathematica, named by Steve himself, was bundled with the NeXT computer). The NeXTStep OS, in the end, built atop Avie Tevanian&#39;s Mach microkernel and with a GUI powered by Adobe&#39;s Display PostScript, begat the modern Mac OS X and the now-ubiquitous iOS. Lots of &#39;failed technology companies&#39; would be thrilled with that kind of legacy.  Finally, there is appreciation, there is gratitude. For all his notable faults, his temper, his intolerance for half-baked efforts, for all the people who both loved and hated working with and for Steve, we still cannot cherish and thank him enough. How many of us owe our livelihoods to the ecosystems and industries he helped create? How many of us spend our days intimately connected with the products he envisioned and shepherded to the market? Today you can walk into hundreds of Apple stores and thousands of other outlets around the world and walk out with a chunk of the future that fits in your pocket. The teams that build the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad are legion, their numbers in the tens of thousands. If not for the vision of one man -- one man who simply refused to accept that good enough was good enough, and who made whole industries over to be right by his exacting standards -- where would we be now?  It is perhaps not all that remarkable that America&#39;s president delivered a statement on the passing of Steve Jobs, as the former CEO of the country&#39;s (and the world&#39;s) most valuable business. It is remarkable, however, to note that the emotional impact of Jobs&#39;s death is the same for Barack Obama as it is for all of us. The two men shared eerily parallel origins; both children of foreign fathers and young American mothers, both raised outside their birth families (Obama by his grandparents, Jobs by his adoptive family), both somehow marked by heritage and circumstance to be destined for the history books and to do things that had never been done before. Now one of them is gone, but just as the world cannot be the same after the election of America&#39;s first biracial president, the world cannot be the same as it was before Steve Jobs.  Namaste, Steve. We remember you with fondness and delight. We wish for your colleagues and for Tim Cook the wisdom and energy to lead Apple the way you would have continued to lead it for many years, if not for the harsh unfairness of cancer and the inevitable tick of life&#39;s clock. And we hope and pray that your wife and children may find a tiny seed of solace in the knowledge that their beloved was our beloved too.

They don&#39;t see Rust as having value and would rather it just goes away.  When I tried to upstream the DRM abstractions last year, that all was blocked on basic support for the concept of a &#34;Device&#34; in Rust. Even just a stub wrapper for struct device would be enough.  That simple concept only recently finally got merged, over one year later.  When I wrote the DRM scheduler abstractions, I ran into many memory safety issues caused by bad design of the underlying C code. The lifetime requirements were undocumented and  boiled down to &#34;design your driver like amdgpu to make it work, or else&#34;.  My driver is not like amdgpu, it fundamentally can&#39;t work the same way. When I tried to upstream minor fixes to the C code to make the behavior more robust and the lifetime requirements sensible, the maintainer blocked it and said I should just do &#34;what other drivers do&#34;.  Even when I pointed out that other C drivers also triggered the same bugs because the API is just bad and unintuitive and there are many secret hidden lifetime requirements, he wouldn&#39;t budge.  One C driver works, so Rust drivers must work the same way.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/08/29/nx-s1-5093882/colorado-hiker-left-behind-office-retreat-mountain">Man on office retreat is rescued from Colorado mountain after getting left behind : NPR</a> - 2024-08-29<span class="secondary"> - The insurance workers were on an office retreat in the Rocky Mountains when they met at dawn to begin a hike to the summit of Mount Shavano.

Teaching to think is just as important as teaching to code, but this is seldom done; I think something I’ve done last month is a great opportunity to draw the curtain a bit. serde is the Rust framework for serialization and deserialization. Everyone uses it, and it’s the default among the ecosystem. serde_json is the official serde “mixin” for JSON, so when people need to parse stuff, that’s what they use instinctively. There are other libraries for JSON parsing, like simd-json, but serde_json is overwhelmingly used: it has 26916 dependents at the time of this post, compared to only 66 for simd-json. This makes serde_json a good target (not in a Jia Tan way) for optimization. Chances are, many of those 26916 users would profit from switching to simd-json, but as long as they aren’t doing that, smaller optimizations are better than nothing, and such improvements are reapt across the ecosystem.</span></li><li><a href="https://gir.st/ircpipe.html">ircpipe - netcat for IRC</a> - 2024-08-24 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41335830" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://symbol.fediverse.info/">fediverse symbol ⁂</a> - 2024-08-24 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41327567" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - We propose the symbol ⁂ to represent the fediverse.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.buzl.uk/2024/08/24/reddit.html">That time Reddit banned me for developing an app</a> - 2024-08-24 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41336446" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - kaangiray26&#39;s blog about software development, technology, qualities in life and more</span></li><li><a href="https://cupofjo.com/2024/08/19/readers-share-their-tattoos/">9 Readers Share Their Beautiful Tattoos | Cup of Jo</a> - 2024-08-24<span class="secondary"> - My friend Alison lost her dad a couple years ago, and she…</span></li><li><a href="https://xeiaso.net/blog/2024/k8s-irc-client/">My IRC client runs on Kubernetes - Xe Iaso</a> - 2024-08-24 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41332427" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - Trust me, there&#39;s a reason for this</span></li><li><a href="https://electriccarsreport.com/2024/08/bmw-overtakes-tesla-in-european-ev-sales-for-first-time/">BMW Overtakes Tesla in European EV Sales For First Time</a> - 2024-08-24 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41333082" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://jnsgr.uk/2024/08/tailscale-on-the-rocks/">Libations: Tailscale on the Rocks · Jon Seager</a> - 2024-08-23 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41314522" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - A deep dive into my home grown cocktail recipe app which speaks Tailscale natively using tsnet, and serves up delicious drinks direct to your tailnet.

The TLC was predicted to be reduced to RV at around 30 meters; below this depth, it was believed that total lung collapse would occur. However, in 1968, French FD Jacques Mayol proved the physiologist wrong when he dove to 70.4 meters. Then, on June 9, 2007, Herbert Nitsch set the current world record for the deepest free dive at 214 meters. This astonishing feat challenged everything physiologists thought they knew about the limits of the human body. Freediving is an extreme sport in which the freediver (FD) descends and returns using a single breath. There are five main subcategories of free diving. Of these, the no-limits category presents FDs with the greatest challenge as they descend using a loaded sleigh and ascend using an air balloon. This allows FD’s to reach extreme depths and pressures. But how extreme is extreme? The normal pressure exerted on a person at sea level is 1 atmosphere absolute (ATA). Every 10 meters a diver descends, they experience a 1ATA increase in pressure. This means that by the time freedivers reach 30 meters, they are already experiencing 4 ATA of pressure. This is around double the pressure in your car tires! At 214 meters, Nitsch experienced 22.3 ATA at which point his lungs were compressed to 0.45 liters in size – that’s just under 2 glasses of water. In addition to the challenges posed by these high pressures, FDs have no access to oxygen (O2) as they are underwater in a hypoxic (no O2) environment. These harsh conditions make FDs a fascinating case study for a better understanding of the endurance of the human body. How is it that organisms made to live on dry land are able to descend 214 meters with one breath? There are several critical physiological responses that are theorized to permit FDs to reach these impressive depths. The first is the mammalian diving reflex. This is an autonomic reflex found in diving mammals that activates a series of responses that reduce O2 consumption following the cessation of breathing, known as apnea. Another critical mechanism is a centralized shift of blood known as the thoracic blood shift (TBS) in which there is movement of blood from the extremities of the body toward the central thoracic cavity. This increase in central blood volume allows for the reduction of TLC past the RV and prevents lung squeeze as the blood occupies the space of the shrunken lungs. Finally, the frog breathing technique permits FD to breathe past their TLC. During frog-breathing, the diver takes gulps air into their lungs after having already filled them. This is thought to increase the oxygen content in their lungs and prolong their time underwater. But as impressive as the physical adaptations of the human body are under these conditions, the mental adaptation might be even more astonishing. FDs have to learn to go against one of the most basic human urges, the urge to breathe. However, there can be serious consequences if this signal is ignored for too long. The drive to breathe arises from high carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in our blood. After we inhale, our cells use up the O2 in our blood and produce CO2. As the CO2 builds up, sensors detect the heightened levels and send a signal to the brain to let it know that it is time to exhale the CO2. However, since FDs often hyperventilate, they reduce the CO2 levels in their blood below the normal level. This causes a delay in the signal to breathe. During this delay, O2 is still being consumed and therefore, a FDs oxygen saturation continues to decrease; if FDs wait too long to breathe, they can lose consciousness. This is known as hypoxic loss of consciousness, or more commonly as shallow water blackout. Anyone who hyperventilates before swimming can be at risk of this! The most serious consequence of a diver losing consciousness is drowning. This is why several safety divers are present during a free dive and ready to pull the FD to the surface if necessary. Every time physiologists believe they have found the absolute limit of free diving, they are disproved by the newest world record. This begs the question – can we find the limit to freediving? Currently, it is believed that maximal diving depth is not restricted by breath-hold time, but rather by the degree of hypoxemia, that is lowest blood oxygen saturation, that can be withstood upon ascent. There is also a distinction to be made between the maximal diving depth without injury determined by the RV/TLC depth and the absolute maximal diving depth using advanced techniques. The latter predicts a maximum depth of 320 meters; however, whether the FD would survive the hypoxemia on ascent is yet to be determined. @DanielaPadres Daniela is a recent B.Sc. graduate from the program of Physiology at McGill.

The main news is that I&#39;m employed again! Once the news about the Textual layoffs hit I, of course, started the job hunting process. This lasted for a wee while (and I have a couple of stories about that -- perhaps I&#39;ll write them up one day). I officially became &#34;unemployed&#34; on April the 1st (yeah, I know), and by the 23rd I had an offer for a new position, which I accepted. As of the time of writing I&#39;ve been in that position for a touch over 3 weeks and it&#39;s going really well. Right at this moment I&#39;m doing zero Python work (that will change, I strongly suspect) and, actually, for the first time ever, I&#39;m writing some TypeScript (it&#39;s tempting me to dive into that some more). The team I&#39;m working in are great and I&#39;m also really impressed so far by the practices they have in place relating to getting stuff done. It&#39;s actually a refreshing change to work in a bigger organisation and actually find it not massively frustrating! I&#39;m also back to working from home full time. This isn&#39;t that big a deal for me as I spent around 22 years doing so up until 2018, and of course it isn&#39;t that big of a deal to many folk these days anyway thanks to the 2020- period. This prompted me to finally clear out the spare room (I&#39;ve only been in here a touch under 5 years so of course there were a lot of &#34;I&#39;ll sort those soon&#34; boxes and stuff in there), buy a second desk, and make a work-coding area that is away from totally separate from my for-fun-coding area. This has turned out to be a really good decision. I love my main hacking space in the living room, and have done a lot of work there, but that was always on the odd days here and there when I&#39;d work at home. Now that working at home is a full-time role it felt important to make the distinction. Weirdly though, all of this means that I&#39;m spending less time working on personal stuff. When I was working at Textualize, most days, I&#39;d be spending the best part of 3 hours in the day getting to and from the office. I thought that perhaps getting that time back would translate into having more time to tinker with my own stuff. Actually what I&#39;m finding I&#39;m doing is I&#39;m spending the time on more general self-care and domestic things. This is a good thing. Doubtless once things really settle down and I form my new routine I&#39;ll dive back into FOSS coding more again, and perhaps get back to streaming while I code. Meanwhile though you can find me steaming many late evenings, mucking about on my PS5. Right at this moment I&#39;m finally playing all the way through Just Cause 4 (a game I bought back in 2019 and never finished). In fact last night I finished the main story. Expect a lot more PS5-based streaming nonsense over the next few months. One other change I have made is to my VR video publishing schedule. For the longest time I had the time and was playing so much that I published a video every day. This wasn&#39;t a schedule I set myself, this was more a case of I was playing so much that to publish less frequently would mean there would be a huge backlog. These days I&#39;m back to working 5 days a week (previously I was working 4 days) so I have to cram a little more into my weekends, and also I want to try and do other things during weekends too. So recently I changed to an every-other-day schedule. And, really, that&#39;s about it. For now expect to see a bit less Python-based content on here, and also quite a bit less Textual-based stuff too. Currently my focus is elsewhere and it also seems that Textual is a bit of a moving target recently, throwing in some fun new bugs and breaking changes which are tricky to keep on top of.

I spent my time with not only the proto-devops-people (this was before devops was cool), but also with the hardcore sysadmins.

I’m talking about E-Mail, Active Directory, DNS, workstation provisioning etc. We used to joke that they were the IT equivalent of sanitation - when everything worked, no one knew you were there, toiling. When things broke, they suddenly remembered who’s responsible for this thing and where to find them. Summer was coming, and I inquired with the person in charge of WSUS (Windows Server Update Services, the Microsoft-blessed way to distribute Windows updates in offline environments) whether they’ve deployed the latest DST-related patches (the DST schedule was modified that year). They replied that no, and in fact they’d like some help in ensuring DST transitioning is disabled on all workstations/servers, as this is how things work here.</span></li><li><a href="https://blog.meain.io/2023/navigating-around-in-shell/">Navigating around in your shell</a> - 2023-11-17 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38291638" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://www.openculture.com/2023/11/marie-curies-research-papers-are-still-radioactive-a-century-later.html">Marie Curie&#39;s Research Papers Are Still Radioactive a Century Later | Open Culture</a> - 2023-11-16<span class="secondary"> - Image by The Wellcome Trust When researching a famous historical figure, access to their work and materials usually proves to be one of the biggest obstacles.</span></li><li><a href="https://wilwheaton.net/2023/11/mind-your-business-and-dont-be-a-dick/">Mind your business, and don’t be a dick. – WIL WHEATON dot NET</a> - 2023-11-16<span class="secondary"> - Someone asked me why Anne and I wear masks to hockey games, and because they weren’t a dick about it, I answered them.

SARS-CoV-2 can cause disseminated infections that result in multi-system tissue damage, dysregulated inflammation, and cellular metabolic disruptions. The tissue damage and inflammation has been shown to impair microvascular circulation, resulting in hypoxia, which coupled with virally-induced metabolic reprogramming, increases cellular anaerobic respiration. Both acute and PASC patients show systemic dysregulation of multiple markers of the acid-base balance. Based on these data, we hypothesize that the shift to anaerobic respiration causes an acid-base disruption that can affect every organ system and underpins the symptoms of PASC. This hypothesis can be tested by longitudinally evaluating acid-base markers in PASC patients and controls over the course of a month. If our hypothesis is correct, this could have significant implications for our understanding of PASC and our ability to develop effective diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. </span></li><li><a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2023/04/16/new-macbooks-at-wwdc-gurman/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=mastodon">Gurman: New MacBooks to Be Announced at WWDC in June - MacRumors</a> - 2023-04-16<span class="secondary"> - Apple is working on a larger 15-inch MacBook Air, an updated 13-inch MacBook Air, and an updated 13-inch MacBook Pro, and at least some of these new...</span></li><li><a href="https://terikanefield.com/a-firehose-of-insanity-and-the-republican-cycle-of-radicalization/">A Firehose of Insanity and The Republican Cycle of Radicalization - Teri Kanefield</a> - 2023-04-16<span class="secondary"> - There was an explosion of news this week with a theme: The increasing radicalization of the Republican Party.

In other words, why does the browser show a scary full-page warning for a certificate that expired one day, or even one hour, ago – the same as a certificate that is self-signed, chains to an unknown root, or presents the wrong name? The premise behind these questions is that an expired certificate (especially one that is recently expired) is not as bad as a certificate with some other type of validation error, and thus the warning UX shouldn’t be as severe.</span></li><li><a href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/streaming-libraries-dvds-blu-rays.html">DVDs and Blu-rays are necessary as streaming changes.</a> - 2023-01-22 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34467490" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - Plus, stories from the recent past of Future Tense.</span></li><li><a href="https://www.arenaev.com/mercedesbenz_is_first_to_get_approval_for_level_3_autonomous_driving_in_us-news-1267.php">Mercedes-Benz is first to get approval for Level 3 autonomous driving in US - ArenaEV</a> - 2023-01-21 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34470491" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - With the help of Drive Pilot, motorists in Nevada will soon be able to take their focus from the road without breaking the law.</span></li><li><a href="https://blog.sanctum.geek.nz/series/unix-as-ide/">Series: Unix as IDE « Arabesque</a> - 2023-01-21 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30169843" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://bsandro.tech/posts/monochrome-terminal-setup-for-an-e-ink-monitor/">Monochrome terminal setup for an E-ink monitor</a> - 2023-01-21 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34410734" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - Thoughts and notes on tech stuff</span></li><li><a href="https://8thlight.com/insights/what-to-know-when-becoming-a-devops-engineer">What to Know When Becoming a DevOps Engineer | 8th Light</a> - 2023-01-21</li><li><a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/no-fly-list-us-tsa-unprotected-server-commuteair/">U.S. No Fly List Left on Unprotected Airline Server</a> - 2023-01-21 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34448155" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - CommuteAir, a regional carrier, left a copy of the U.S. No Fly List on an unsecured server that could be viewed by anyone.</span></li><li><a href="https://copydennis.com/">Copy Dennis — Collection © 2022</a> - 2023-01-21 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34375054" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - This collection is a tribute to all the creators who have taken a little bit too much inspiration from the portfolio website of © Dennis Snellenberg</span></li><li><a href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2023/01/19/time/">Setting the clock ahead to see what breaks</a> - 2023-01-21 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34449310" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a></li><li><a href="https://kottke.org/23/01/magnificent-black-white-photos-of-the-earth-rising-over-the-moon">Magnificent Black &amp; White Photos of the Earth Rising Over the Moon</a> - 2023-01-21<span class="secondary"> -     South Korea currently has a probe called Danuri orbiting the Moon at an altitude of about 62 miles above the surface.

There&#39;s a public mailing list, dev-security-policy@mozilla.org, where the major browser developers decide whether they should keep trusting a CA. And sometimes it&#39;s fun to watch the results. Sometimes the CA in question takes a hostile stance of &#34;whatever nerds, what are you gonna do, shut us down?&#34; and then the nerds shut them down. Turns out it&#39;s hard to sell certificates that web browsers don&#39;t trust.  I had my attention drawn to the TrustCor saga because GitHub Dependabot won&#39;t shut up about it. Every time I push anything that might involve a certificate, it tells me about the grave danger I might be in if I trust TrustCor, and gives me a helpful link to the shit that went down [https://groups.google.com/a/mozilla.org/g/dev-security-policy/c/oxX69KFvsm4].  The beginning of the story seems to be that a journalist was investigating spyware in mobile apps, and finding the companies that seemed to be ultimately responsible for creating them. There was evidence [https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/news/252527174/TrustCor-under-fire-over-certificate-authority-concerns] that one such company was TrustCor, one of the certificate authorities that used to be trusted by every web browser.  In particular, TrustCor had put a mobile app on the Google App Store that contained one such spyware package, Measurement Systems. It was the only unobfuscated version of the package anyone had ever seen, implying that they didn&#39;t just license it from some other company, and it seemed that something in the code phoned home to a server at TrustCor.  So that led to some questions. These questions weren&#39;t initially &#34;should TrustCor shut down as a CA&#34;, because none of this was strictly about certificates.  I&#39;m sure TrustCor&#39;s VP of operations had a lot of ways to respond to this, but here are some of the responses she chose:   * Measurement Systems isn&#39;t the same company as us  * And anyway that was a single rogue developer  * And anyway that was a beta version of an app that we withdrew  * What did you expect us to do, use an ineffective old analytics package like Firebase, or use the powerful, beautiful, sexy analytics from Measurement Systems? Who are not us by the way  * You&#39;re a bunch of ignorant meddlers who don&#39;t know anything about the CA business  * You&#39;re after us because we make an encrypted e-mail product and you secretly work for the US government and want to shut us down  * Your claims are false and you can&#39;t prove anything  If you read enough of the thread, it&#39;s clear that not every accusation against TrustCor was true, and it&#39;s hard to tell what the truth really was. But also it doesn&#39;t matter, because once TrustCor had written the open letter [https://trustcor.com/static/falseclaimsandmedia.txt] saying  &gt; It is filled with ridiculous, false claims and out-of-context statements twisted to fulfill a baseless prophecy imagined by a group of researchers who are more concerned with enriching themselves and their company than they are with Internet security.  their fate was sealed.  The conclusion on the mailing list was roughly: look, we&#39;re not here to find you guilty in a court of law, we&#39;re here to decide whether we trust you, and after all that we definitely don&#39;t. Your certificates get yeeted out of browsers at the end of November, have fun.  And just to make the point, they did what they could to make every other software developer know not to trust TrustCor either. They put &#34;trusting TrustCor&#34; into the big database of software vulnerabilities. Again, that&#39;s why I heard about it. Because now pushing code to GitHub that might still accept a TrustCor certificate, if it saw one, is a Moderate Severity Vulnerability.  What&#39;s funny to me is that the TrustCor VP seems like she was almost on the right track. If she really wanted to win the moral high ground at all costs, instead of accusing people of secretly working for the government, she could have pointed out that most of the people on that mailing list work either for or with Google. The world&#39;s largest ad company. The company that tracks everyone on 90% of web sites via Google Analytics. The company that also distributes spyware, because they don&#39;t check what their ad customers are doing very well and let them run random JavaScript on random web pages. The certificate authority whose company is, in absolute terms, up to more shady shit than any other CA.  Saying that would have gotten her company destroyed even faster, but I think she would have been right.</span></li><li><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2023/01/ice_cubes_app_store_limbo">Daring Fireball: App Store Rejection of the Week: Ice Cubes, a Splendid New Mastodon Client</a> - 2023-01-19 - <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34444514" rel="noopener"><img src="https://news.ycombinator.com/y18.gif" height="14em" title="View on Hacker News" alt="Hacker News logo"></a><span class="secondary"> - We’re now on the cusp of a new frontier with Mastodon, and it’s Apple’s utterly clueless bureaucratic App Store reviewers who are doing their best to lock the new playground’s gates before they even open.</span></li><li><a href="https://furbo.org/2022/09/13/behind-the-app-wallaroo/">Behind the App: Wallaroo • furbo.org</a> - 2023-01-19<span class="secondary"> - It’s been awhile since I’ve done one of these deep dives on what goes on behind the scenes during the development of an Iconfactory app. There’s a common thread to each one: I feel the need to document our work when there’s a major change in how we build user interfaces.

There are a few elegant in-house monitoring systems at LinkedIn that provide network switch level metrics, logs, and even flow-level visibility by sampling packets going through our network.
